To install, first download and install miniconda (I don't think the conda version should
make a difference), then open the terminal in this folder and type"

conda env create -f .\env_psychopy.yml

Afterwards, activate that conda envirionment:

conda activate psychopy

Then run:

python visuastim_main.py
